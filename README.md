_The texturer's mod_
###### note: I really like the word supreme.
## About this mod
This mod is made by texturers and modellers.
They're sending us a model / texture,
and we're adding it (for free!).
DanielGolan is the supreme coder, 
and peanut is the supreme 32pixel texturer.
## Licsense
This is the supreme Licsense,
and it's more effective than the MIT one.
